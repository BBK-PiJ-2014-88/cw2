"In Fraction the add etc. methods are a little verbose; you should collapse the code to not use the local variables. Even though the functionality of the code is fairly obvious it is still worth including some documentation/comments for the user/maintainer of your code. When you get to javadoc that will assist you. Similar comments apply to the calculator. Too much code in the test branches. It would be useful to decompose the code to use more methods. A general heuristic is to keep the code length for a method to, at most, half a page. If at all possible try and avoid assigning true/false to a boolean, e.g., boolean checkUnit = false;. Better to assign the expression to the variable (if you need the variable at all). try and avoid code such as if(!(str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""0"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""1"") 			||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""2"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""3"") 			||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""4"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""5"") 			||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""6"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""7"") 			||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""8"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""9"") 			||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""-"")||str.substring(y,y 1).equals(""/""))){ 				isValid = false; - use a set instead or put the valid responses into an array and check that the char is a member of that array. Good set of tests. Generally, if a test is successful then it is quiet."
