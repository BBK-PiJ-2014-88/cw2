The values of double fields 'amount' on Point 4 were not correct. I recommend that you re-do the exercise, checking carefully the execution line by line. Agree a face-to-face check with Keith or Sergio if you think that can help. Additionally, remember that Strings are complex data types, and therefore consist of a pointer and an object in the heap. They are not simple types (small boxes) with a simple value like ints.
